    <title>FsBlog - F# static site generation</title>
    <link>http://saxonmatt.co.uk/FsBlog</link>
    <description>
    FsBlog aims to be a blog-aware static site generator, mostly built in F#. But don't worry, 
    you won't even need to know any F# to get up and running. So long as you are comfortable 
    using a command line or terminal, and have a degree of familiarity with Markdown and Razor 
    syntax - you're good to go!</description>

If you've much experience with other static site generators like Octopress or Jekyll most of this should be fairly familiar, if not, hopefully it won't be too difficult to pick up.
